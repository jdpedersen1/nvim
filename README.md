# My Neovim Config
![](nvimconfig.png)

- Currently manage my plugins using Lazy.nvim
- Modular structure allows for easy editing and customizing 
- Keymap set in keys.lua to allow for movement within file while still in insert mode using the hjkl
- Bonus custom lua script to prompt for user to select if they want to create a backup of the current file when they write. If user selects yes, it not only saves the current file, but 
creates a second copy of the file as a backup in a completely different directory, if no is selected, then only the current file is saved and no backup is created.
